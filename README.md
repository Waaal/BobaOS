## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è BobaOS is not ready for any task (or even proper booting yet), but feel free to explore the code and follow along.

### Requirements

- Linux as development environment
- NASM
- x86_64-elf cross-compiler
- make
- QEMU
- GDB

### Building, Booting & Debugging
There is a script provided for building, running and debugging


```bash
build.sh    # Build the project with makefile and x86_64 elf cross-compiler
boot.sh     # Boot the project with qemu
debug.sh    # Debug the project with qemu and gdb
```


The buildscript requires that you have the cross compiler at /home/USERNAME/opt/cross64


The debugging script will launch gdb and qemu for you and break at the kernel entry
