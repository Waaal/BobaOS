# Virtual keyboard layer
Virtual keyboard layer is a layer that allows the kernel to support a lot of differnt keyboard driver. Because the VKL abstracts out low level keyboad driver and provides funtions for interacting with one.

So with VKL the interface to interact with a keyboad remains the same for different keyboards.

*Note: Abstraction works with function pointer*
